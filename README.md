## Development Commands

| `yarn build` | Build production-ready static files |
| `yarn serve` | Preview built files locally |

### Development Workflow

1. **Start development**: Run `yarn dev` to launch the local server
2. **Edit content**: Make changes to your markdown files - they'll update automatically
3. **Navigation changes**: If you modify the sidebar navigation, restart the development server
4. **Preview production**: Use `yarn build` followed by `yarn serve` to test the final build

> **💡 Tip**: The development server supports hot reloading for most changes, making your workflow smooth and efficient!
