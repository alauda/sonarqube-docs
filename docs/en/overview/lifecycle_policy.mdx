# Lifecycle Policy

## Version Lifecycle Timeline

Below is the lifecycle timeline for released versions of the `Alauda Build of SonarQube` operator:

| Version | Release Date | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| v2025.1.z | 2025-04-08   | 2026-04-08   |

## Release Policy

A new version of the `Alauda Build of SonarQube` operator is released every 1 year, updating the operator to the second-latest minor version released by SonarQube (typically using the first patch version for stability). If the SonarQube official team announces a minor version release schedule, we will also adjust our release timeline accordingly.

::: tip Differences Between Alauda and SonarQube Versions
Alauda's SonarQube operator versions are typically one minor version (4-6 months) behind the latest official SonarQube release.

## Maintenance Policy

Alauda provides 12 months of maintenance support for each released minor version of the SonarQube operator.

During the maintenance period, the following support is included:

1. Follow up on patch versions released by SonarQube official, promptly providing patches that include bug fixes and security updates
2. Provide security version updates that comply with Alauda's security specifications
3. Assist customers in smoothly upgrading SonarQube operators to new versions

Additionally, Alauda will release security version updates every two months during the maintenance period to ensure the security and stability of the operators.
